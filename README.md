# Landing Page

This repository contains a landing page built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. I created a responsive web page to match a reference image of a complete website. 

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, this project demonstrates proficiency in: 
 - Flexbox layout principles
 - Implementation of responsive layouts that adapt to varying viewport dimensions
 - Translation of visual mockups into a functional web page
 - Organization of HTML/CSS architecture for more sophisticated layouts
